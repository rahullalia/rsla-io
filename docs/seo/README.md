## Google Sheet Tracker

**Claude Blog SEO Tracker**: [Open Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BffZHKJRirOrj-fUPBh56l9KjIlh2Wo-5fyHY-Kd-Xw/edit)

This is the live tracker. Update it every time you work on a blog post. Columns include status, Sanity draft, meta title/description, internal links, images, pre-rendering, published date, URL slug, and GSC indexing.

**Status flow:** Not Started > Research > Drafting > Review > Published

## How to Write a Blog Post

1. **Pick a post** from `contentPlan.md` (follow the publishing schedule)
2. **Interview Rahul first** — ask the 6 questions in the "Interview Rahul First" section of contentPlan.md. Do not skip this. His personal experience is what makes each post rank.
3. **Draft the post** using `/blogEngine` skill. Follow the product tag (which Claude product the post covers), internal linking rules, and keyword targets listed for that post.
4. **Generate a featured image** using the Gemini API instructions in contentPlan.md. Blue-gray palette, 1200x630, no text on image.
5. **Publish to Sanity** as a blogPostV2 document. Set SEO fields (meta title, description, slug).
6. **Pre-render** by running `npm run build` (triggers prerender.mjs).
7. **Update the Google Sheet** — change status to Published, check all completed boxes, add published date and URL slug.
8. **Submit to GSC** — request indexing in Google Search Console for the new URL.

## Key Rules

- Every post links to Post 0 ("Anthropic Has 5 Different Claude Products...") and Post 6 (pillar page)
- Posts tagged `[ALL PRODUCTS]` must have separate sections per product (Claude.ai, Claude Code, API)
- Do not write generic AI content. Every post needs Rahul's real experience, specific numbers, named tools, and honest opinions.
- Update the Google Sheet after every action. No exceptions.
