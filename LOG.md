## 2026-05-04 - Evergreen Blog Format + Repo Cleanup

### What happened
Implemented an evergreen blog format optimized for SEO/AEO/GEO. Added structured instant-value sections that serve both human readers and AI/search engines. Also cleaned ~18,000 lines of dead code from both rslaWebsite and rslaStudio repos.

### Schema changes (rslaStudio)
- Added `keyTakeaways` field (string array, 3-7 items, max 150 chars each) for featured snippet targeting
- Added `bottomLine` field (text, max 300 chars) for AEO conclusion extraction
- Tightened validation: title 70 chars, excerpt 160, metaDescription 155, featuredImage.alt 125
- Renamed `pullQuote` label to "TL;DR" with clearer description for editors

### Frontend changes (BlogInner.jsx)
- Key Takeaways renders as styled bullet list in bordered card (`.key-takeaways` class)
- Bottom Line section after article body in matching card (`.bottom-line` class)
- TL;DR section gets `.tldr` class for speakable targeting
- BlogPosting JSON-LD now includes `wordCount` and `speakable` specification

### Prerender changes (prerender.mjs)
- Fetches `keyTakeaways`, `bottomLine`, editorial `updatedAt` (falls back to `_updatedAt`)
- Outputs both sections as semantic HTML with `aria-label` and proper heading hierarchy
- TL;DR gets `.tldr` class in prerendered HTML
- JSON-LD includes `speakable`, `wordCount`, `dateModified`

### Repo cleanup
- rslaStudio: removed stale contentStrategy docs (archived), one-off scripts, post markdown files, executed plan docs. Added BRAIN.md, GEMINI.md, TODO.md.
- rslaWebsite: removed `content/posts/post11-22.md`, `content/scripts/` (57 files), `docs/conversionResearch/`, `docs/plan.md`, `docs/sessionHistory.md`, `docs/uiComponents.md`, stale superpowers plans, unused `Button` and `NumberTicker` UI components.
- Total removed: ~18,000 lines across both repos.

### Commits
- `bdf11a5` feat(blog): add evergreen format with key takeaways, bottom line, and enhanced schema
- `e2d3342` chore: remove stale docs, executed plans, and numbered post drafts
- `964b949` chore: remove 57 one-off content scripts (all previously executed)

## 2026-05-04 - Blog Listing + Inner Page Redesign

### What happened
Full redesign of both blog pages inspired by Riverside.com/blog. Iterated through multiple rounds of feedback on layout, typography, spacing, and component design.

### Blog listing page (`Blog.jsx`)
- Riverside-style hero: featured post (left 58%) + "Trending topics to read" dark banner + 3 sidebar posts (right 42%) with thumbnails, category tags, dates
- "All Articles" section with dropdown category filter + full-width search bar
- Newsletter card (MagicCard spotlight effect, blue border) at position 2 in grid on page 1
- 8 posts/page on page 1 (+ newsletter = 9 grid items), 9 posts/page on page 2+
- Scroll-to-top on page/category change
- Removed: popular posts section, explore topics, resources section, author from cards

### Blog inner page (`BlogInner.jsx`)
- Dark hero header (bg-black): title left 60% + landscape image right 40%, breadcrumb, author + role, date + reading time
- Black sticky ToC sidebar (rounded-xl): white text, blue underline on active section (not blue text)
- Body text: 20px black (`text-text`) with 1.6 line-height (was 18px gray)
- Heading sizes: H2 28-32px, H3 22-24px (closer to Riverside)
- Mobile ToC also black to match desktop
- Removed: case study section, share links from ToC, "In this article" label
- Reading progress bar + active heading tracker optimized with requestAnimationFrame (fixes scroll lag)
- Emil design polish: active:scale on cards, stagger animation on related posts, transition underlines

### Other changes
- `PortableTextRenderer.jsx`: body text to 20px black, lists to match, heading sizes adjusted
- `queries.ts`: added blogHeroPostsQuery, blogPopularPostsQuery, blogCategoriesWithCountQuery, keyTakeaways field
- `postcss` updated 8.5.6 -> 8.5.14 (Dependabot alert #17 resolved)
- Custom arrow SVG added to `public/images/icons/`

### Decisions made
- **No "popular posts" section.** No real popularity signal exists. Featured hero handles curation, All Articles is the archive. Simpler and honest.
- **Featured image standardized at 1200x630.** Used for hero, listing cards, OG tags, WhatsApp/iMessage previews. Inline body images remain flexible.
- **Black header + black ToC** for high contrast editorial feel. Body stays white with black text.
- **Key Takeaways field** added to Sanity query but UI only renders when data exists. Schema update needed in Sanity studio separately.
- **8+1 pagination on page 1.** Newsletter card takes a grid slot, so 8 posts + 1 newsletter = 9 items (3 full rows). Page 2+ gets 9 posts, no newsletter.

### Commits
- `39f7901` redesign(blog): overhaul blog listing and inner pages
- `a59ac36` fix(deps): update postcss to 8.5.14 to resolve XSS vulnerability

### Still pending
- ~~Sanity schema: add `keyTakeaways` field to blogPostV2~~ (done 2026-05-04, now string array)
- Sanity schema: ensure all featured images are uploaded at 1200x630
- Mobile: tested and working on iPhone SE (375px) and iPad (768px), but should verify on physical devices

## 2026-04-30 - GTM Conversion Tracking Complete

### What happened
Completed the GTM conversion tracking setup that was started on 2026-04-23. Fixed incorrect firing triggers on event tags (were set to "Initialization - All Pages" instead of matching custom event triggers). Added `dataLayer.push({ event: 'cta_click' })` to all 6 contact CTA links in code because React Router Link clicks don't produce a Click URL for GTM's click-based triggers.

### Changes
- Fixed CE - Booking Confirmed tag trigger (was firing on every page load)
- Fixed CE - Newsletter Subscribe tag trigger (same issue)
- Added `source` event parameter to newsletter tag (distinguishes insider vs lead magnet signups)
- Created `dlv - source` and `dlv - cta_location` Data Layer Variables in GTM
- Changed CTA trigger from "All Elements / Click URL contains /contact" to Custom Event `cta_click`
- Added `dataLayer.push` with `cta_location` to: HeroV2, FooterV2, NavbarV3 (desktop + mobile), Home.jsx, ServiceDetail.jsx
- Published GTM container Version 5

### Commits
- `db09d04` feat(tracking): add cta_click dataLayer events to all contact CTAs

### Still pending
- Mark `booking_confirmed`, `newsletter_subscribe`, `cta_click` as Key Events in GA4 once they appear in Admin > Events (24-48 hours)

## 2026-04-22 - Code Audit & Fixes

### What happened
Full codebase audit across all layers: config, API routes, components, pages, hooks, Sanity queries, build scripts, and Tailwind config. 30 issues identified and fixed.

### All fixes

| # | Issue | Severity | Fix |
|---|-------|----------|-----|
| 1 | Prerender HTML flash before React renders | Critical | Inline `<style>#prerender{display:none}</style>` in `<head>` with `<noscript>` fallback |
| 2 | CSP blocked Meta Pixel | Critical | Added Facebook domains to `script-src`, `connect-src`, `img-src` in `vercel.json` |
| 3 | `lazyRetry` infinite reload loop | Critical | `sessionStorage` guard; falls back to NotFound on second failure |
| 4 | Sentry DSN empty in `.env.local` | Critical | Confirmed set in Vercel env vars; only affects local dev |
| 5 | No rate limiting on `subscribe.mjs` | High | In-memory IP-based rate limiter (5 req/min/IP) |
| 6 | No rate limiting on `llm/[slug].mjs` | High | In-memory IP-based rate limiter (30 req/min/IP) + GET-only method check |
| 7 | Build scripts silently swallow failures | High | `console.error` + `process.exitCode = 1` |
| 8 | Sanity fetches missing isMounted guards | High | Added guards and `.catch()` to `BlogPreview.jsx`, `LeadMagnet.jsx` |
| 9 | GSAP opacity-0 flash on 5 components | High | Added `opacity-0` CSS class to animated elements |
| 10 | Seo.jsx stale meta tags across routes | High | Full cleanup of all meta tags on unmount |
| 11 | 13 dead Sanity queries | Medium | Removed all V1 queries and unused V2 queries from `queries.ts` |
| 12 | 4 dead components | Medium | Deleted `HowItWorks`, `SystemArchitecture`, `MarqueeV2`, `ProofSection` |
| 13 | NavbarV3 mobile menu missing Escape + scroll lock | Medium | Added Escape key handler and `overflow: hidden` on body |
| 14 | V1/V2 case study fallback (V1 fully migrated) | Medium | Removed V1 fallback in `WorkInner.jsx` and `caseStudyBySlugQuery` |
| 15 | ServicesV2 infinite GSAP loops burning CPU off-screen | Medium | Added `usePauseOffscreen` hook using IntersectionObserver; all 5 timelines start paused and only play when visible |
| 16 | Package name was `"temp-vite"` | Low | Renamed to `"rsla-website"` |
| 17 | `@types/react-router-dom@5` stale | Low | Removed (router v7 ships its own types) |
| 18 | `@types/canvas-confetti` in wrong deps section | Low | Moved to `devDependencies` |
| 19 | `@gsap/react` in manualChunks but unused | Low | Removed from chunks |
| 20 | `rollupOptions.external: []` no-op | Low | Removed |
| 21 | `motion` manualChunks didn't match `motion/react` | Low | Added `motion/react` to chunk config |
| 22 | Unused Tailwind: `accent-wash`, `font-editorial`, `font-drama`, `marquee-scroll`, `marquee-reverse` | Low | Removed |
| 23 | Backward-compat color aliases only used in dead components | Low | Removed |
| 24 | `JSON_LD_ID` unused variable in Seo.jsx | Low | Removed |
| 25 | Blog debounce timer ref not cleared on unmount | Low | Added cleanup `useEffect` |

| 26 | `firstName` not sanitized in subscribe endpoint | Low | Strip HTML tags before sending to Kit |
| 27 | Lead magnet pages missing from prerender | Low | Added lead magnet fetch + pre-rendering to `prerender.mjs` (2 pages); intentionally excluded from sitemap since they're `noIndex` |
| 28 | Dual analytics (GA4 + Meta Pixel standalone + GTM) | Medium | Removed standalone GA4 and Meta Pixel from `index.html` (were double-tracking). Consolidated to GTM-only, loaded unconditionally. Cookie banner kept as transparency measure, no longer gates tag loading |

### Decisions made
- **All tracking loads unconditionally.** GTM manages GA4 and Meta Pixel. No consent gating. US-based B2B company; CCPA requires opt-out not opt-in. If EU traffic grows, configure Google Consent Mode v2 in GTM (no code change needed).
- **V1 Sanity schemas are dead.** All 8 V1 case studies have matching V2 entries. V1 fallback code removed. V1 documents can be deleted from Sanity when ready.
- **Cookie banner is transparency-only.** Accept/Decline stored in localStorage but does not control any tag loading.

- **CRITICAL:** Synced DiscoveryCall title/schema with prerender (ContactPage JSON-LD added)
- **HIGH:** Optimized page titles for CTR: Services (16->52 chars), Work (20->52 chars), Blog (12->56 chars), About (13->45 chars)
- **HIGH:** Updated Services H1 from generic "What we can help you with." to "What we build for B2B companies."
- **HIGH:** Added `dateModified`, `image`, and `publisher.logo` to prerender BlogPosting schema
- **HIGH:** Added BreadcrumbList schema to case study pages

- **INFRA:** Replaced in-memory rate limiting with Upstash Redis (graceful fallback when env vars not set)

### Commits
- `dd283ef` fix(seo): optimize titles, sync schemas, add redirects, update prerender
- `f60eecb` feat(tracking): add dataLayer events for booking, newsletter, lead magnet conversions
- `17a016e` fix: noIndex thin service pages, add cross-links, replace in-memory rate limiting

### Decisions made
- **Service detail pages noIndexed.** They're thin content (1 sentence + CTA) with 0-5 organic impressions each. Will be re-indexed when expanded with full content.
- **Pillar page strategy planned.** 3 hub pages: GHL Complete Guide, AI Automation for B2B, Local SEO Playbook. Strategy doc at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-27-pillar-page-strategy.md`.
- **Rate limiting now requires Upstash.** Code falls back gracefully (no rate limiting) when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` env var is not set.

### Still pending
See `BRAIN.md > TODO (Next Session)` for the full checklist.

### SEO data audit insights
- Blog post titles and meta descriptions are already well-optimized in Sanity. CTR problem is position-based (avg pos 6-10), not copy-based.
- Top keyword opportunity: "gohighlevel pricing" (2,900 monthly volume, position 9, 88K impressions)
- Content split: 80% of organic clicks from GHL content, 15% from Claude/AI content, 5% from local SEO
- 46/103 pages had only 1 internal link (addressed with cross-linking code, pillar pages will further improve)
- Backlink profile: 91% low-authority, 59% Singapore, 15% Moldova. Needs disavow.

### Session summary
4 commits across security audit, SEO fixes, conversion tracking, and infrastructure. Net result: -406 lines of dead code, +200 lines of SEO/schema/redirect improvements, 33 new 301 redirects, Upstash rate limiting, cross-linked service and case study pages.
