# RSL/A Website — TODO

## P0: SEO — Next Actions (from SEMRush audit 2026-03-25)

- [ ] **Domain redirects in Vercel** — Add rslmediahub.com, .net, .xyz, myrsla.com, connectrsl.com as 301 redirects to rsla.io in Vercel dashboard. Change nameservers in Hostinger to `ns1.vercel-dns.com` / `ns2.vercel-dns.com`. (In progress — TXT verification pending for some domains)
- [ ] **Sanity blog audit** — 32 of 60 published blog posts have `publishedAt` in the future or missing, so they don't appear in sitemap or on the site. Need to audit all blogPostV2 documents and fix dates. This would take sitemap from 58 to ~90 URLs.
- [ ] **More client backlinks** — Add "Website by RSL/A" dofollow footer link to: Freedom Drivers, Spice on a Slice, United Sikhs, any other client sites Rahul built. Fieldshare already done.
- [ ] **Monitor CTR on GHL pricing page** — Check GSC in 2-3 weeks. Baseline: 0.02% CTR on 35K impressions. Target: 1%+ (350+ clicks/mo). New title/desc deployed 2026-03-25.
- [ ] **Monitor salon CRM ranking** — Check GSC for "best crm for hair salons 2025 or 2026". Baseline: position 2.97. Target: #1. New meta deployed 2026-03-25.
- [ ] **Re-run SEMRush audit in 4 weeks** (~April 22) — Measure: indexed pages (should jump), orphaned pages (should be 0), pages with 1 internal link (should drop from 42 to under 10), keyword positions.
- [ ] **Commercial-intent landing pages** — Create content targeting: "AI automation agency", "GoHighLevel setup service", "marketing automation consultant". These are buying-intent keywords with zero current content. (Deferred — discuss in future session)
- [ ] **Backlink outreach to GHL ecosystem** — Guest posts on ghlcentral.com, gohighimpact.co. Share content in GHL Facebook groups. (Deferred — manual relationship work)
- [ ] **Request re-indexing in GSC** — Submit for re-indexing: /blog/go-high-level-pricing, /blog/best-crm-hair-stylists-salon-owners, /blog/go-high-level-new-features-2025, /blog/ai-lead-follow-up-system

## P0: Programmatic SEO — Next Actions

- [ ] **WAIT: Check Google Search Console indexation** in 2 to 4 weeks (around April 6 to 13). Target: 9+ of 12 pages indexed. If under 60%, template needs more unique content before scaling.
- [ ] Add more industry pages: law firms, financial advisors, small business, marketing agencies, salons, mortgage brokers (BLOCKED: wait for indexation data first)
- [ ] Add service pages: voice agents, AI receptionist, chatbots, database reactivation, lead nurturing, email automation, appointment booking, sales automation (8 pages, next batch after industries)
- [ ] Add comparison pages: GHL vs HubSpot, GHL vs Salesforce, GHL vs Pipedrive, etc. (10 pages)
- [ ] Build a `/solutions` directory page listing all industry pages (optional, for browsing)
- [ ] Track which pages rank and for which keywords (consider SerpBear self-hosted tracker)
- [x] Add "Industries We Serve" grid to Services page — DONE
- [x] Add "Solutions" column to footer — DONE
- [x] Add tool pages: GoHighLevel, n8n, Make, Zapier — DONE (4 pages live)

- [x] Change heading to "We have worked with"
- [x] Reorder logos — high-profile names visible when user scrolls to section

## P5: Privacy & Compliance

## SERP Site Name

- Technical implementation is correct (WebSite JSON-LD, og:site_name, title all say "RSL/A")
- User submitted re-index request in Google Search Console
- Google just needs time to process — no code changes needed
- Check back in 2-4 weeks
