/**
 * Pre-render static HTML for all pages (indexed and non-indexed).
 *
 * Runs after `vite build`. For each page:
 * 1. Reads the built dist/index.html as template (has all hashed script/link tags)
 * 2. Replaces meta tags (title, description, OG, Twitter, canonical) with page-specific values
 * 3. Injects semantic HTML content into <div id="root">...</div>
 * 4. Writes to the correct filesystem path (e.g., dist/about/index.html)
 *
 * Vercel serves filesystem files before rewrites, so pre-rendered pages
 * get served directly. React's createRoot().render() replaces the injected
 * content when JS loads — users see normal SPA behavior.

</section>

<section><h2>About the Founder</h2>
<p>I have spent the better part of five years in the trenches of marketing, automation, and business infrastructure. Started in analytics. Got laid off. Built an agency from nothing. And along the way, I watched founders with real talent suffocate under work that never should have touched their hands.</p>
<p>That became the only question worth answering: how do you build systems that actually run a business, not just look good in a demo?</p>
<p>I put everything out there. The strategies, the tools, the exact workflows. You can learn all of it from my content. But knowing how it works and actually building it so it holds under pressure and scales without breaking? That demands precision. That is what RSL/A exists to do.</p>

<h1>"What a privilege to be tired from work you once begged the universe for..."</h1>

<section><h2>How it started</h2>
<p>I started my career in marketing analytics. Numbers, dashboards, attribution models. I was the guy staring at spreadsheets while everyone else was making the creative decisions.</p>
<p>Then I got laid off.</p>
<p>And honestly? It was the best thing that happened to me. Because it forced me to build something on my own.</p>
<p>I started an agency. The classic social media marketing agency thing. Posting content, running accounts, doing the hustle. But I kept noticing the same pattern with every client I worked with.</p>
<p>They were not struggling because they lacked talent. They were drowning in manual work.</p>
<p>Following up with leads at midnight. Copy-pasting between three different tools. Losing deals because they forgot to reply. Running ads with zero tracking. Paying for five different software subscriptions that did not talk to each other.</p>
<p>And you know what? Most of the "solutions" out there made it worse. More tools, more complexity, more things to manage.</p>
<p>So I started asking a different question. What if AI could handle all the stuff that founders should not be doing manually? Not theoretical AI. Not "we will build you a chatbot" AI. Practical, measured, actually-useful-for-your-business AI. That became the whole thing.</p>
</section>

<section><h2>What I actually do</h2>
<p>I show founders how to put AI to work in their business. Then I build it for them.</p>
<p>The teaching part is free. I post the workflows, the tools, the exact systems. No gatekeeping. If you can build it yourself after watching my content, I genuinely want that for you.</p>
<p>But here is the thing. There is a difference between knowing what to build and building it right. A system that works for 10 leads breaks at 500. An AI bot that sounds great in a demo falls apart with real customers. The gap between a prototype and a production system is where most founders get stuck. That is where RSL/A comes in. My team and I are the ones who build the production version. The one that actually scales, actually handles edge cases, and actually shows you the numbers so you know it is working.</p>
</section>

<section><h2>Why I am different</h2>
<p>I came from analytics. That matters.</p>
<p>Most people in this space show you a demo and call it done. I show you a dashboard. Real numbers. What the AI system did this week, how many leads it handled, how many meetings it booked, what the conversion rate was. Because if you cannot measure it, it is just a toy. And founders do not need toys. They need infrastructure.</p>

<h1>What we build for B2B companies.</h1>
<p>We do not do "marketing." We build AI infrastructure for founders. Here is what that actually means.</p>

<section id="lead-generation"><h2>Lead Gen: Stop paying for clicks. Start paying for customers.</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Most founders either boost posts and hope for the best, or they hire an agency that shows them impressions and reach numbers. Neither gets you customers.</p>
<h3>What We Build</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Targeting that learns:</strong> Your campaigns learn which audiences convert and shift budget toward them automatically. No manual bid adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Creative testing at scale:</strong> We test dozens of ad variations simultaneously. AI identifies the winners and kills the losers before they waste your money.</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline integration:</strong> Every qualified lead flows directly into your CRM. Tagged, scored, and ready for follow-up. No spreadsheets, no manual entry.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time dashboards:</strong> You see exactly what your ad spend is producing. Not vanity metrics. Revenue metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>$600 in ad spend turned into $36,000 in closed revenue in 45 days. That is a 60x return. Not because of magic creative. Because the AI system optimized faster than any human could.</em></p>
</section>

<section id="automations"><h2>Zero Manual Work: Your business should not stop working when you do.</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>A lead messages you at 11 PM. You see it at 8 AM. By then they have already talked to two of your competitors. You lost the deal because you were sleeping. That is not a business problem. That is an infrastructure problem.</p>
<h3>What We Build</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conversational bots:</strong> Not the robotic "please select an option" kind. Actual AI that understands context, qualifies leads, answers questions, and books meetings. At 2 AM. At 2 PM. Whenever.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow automations:</strong> Lead comes in, gets tagged, gets the right follow-up sequence, gets routed to the right person. Automatically. You do not touch it.</li>
<li><strong>Customer service AI:</strong> Handle the 80% of customer questions that are the same thing asked slightly differently. Your team focuses on the 20% that actually need a human.</li>
<li><strong>Database reactivation:</strong> Got a list of cold contacts collecting dust? AI wakes them up. Personalized outreach at scale, not mass blasts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We built an AI chat system for an e-commerce brand that cut manual customer service hours by 80%. And the customers rated the experience higher than when humans were handling it.</em></p>
</section>

<section id="operations"><h2>Operations: Stop managing tools. Let AI manage your business.</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>You are paying for Calendly. And Mailchimp. And some CRM you barely use. And a website builder. And a texting platform. And maybe two more things you forgot about. None of them talk to each other. You are the integration layer. That is expensive. Not just the subscriptions. Your time.</p>
<h3>What We Build</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified pipeline:</strong> Every lead, every deal, every customer in one place. AI tells you what needs attention today, not a spreadsheet you forgot to update.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent follow ups:</strong> The system knows when someone has not responded and sends the right nudge at the right time. Not a generic "just checking in" email. Something contextual.</li>
<li><strong>Automated reporting:</strong> Stop building reports manually. Your dashboard updates in real time. Revenue, pipeline, conversion rates. All of it.</li>
<li><strong>Calendar and booking integration:</strong> One link, one system, no double bookings, no "let me check my availability" back and forth.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We reactivated a dead database of 13,000 cold contacts and booked 42 qualified appointments in one week. Not by emailing everyone the same thing. By using AI to personalize outreach based on what we knew about each contact.</em></p>
</section>

<section id="digital-presence"><h2>Digital Presence: Your website should work as hard as you do.</h2>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>You have a website. It looks okay. But it is basically a digital business card that does not do anything. No one finds it on Google. The few people who do visit do not convert. And you have no idea why because there is no data.</p>
<h3>What We Build</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conversion-focused design:</strong> Every page built around one goal: getting the visitor to take the next step. Tested layouts and copy that improve over time.</li>
<li><strong>SEO infrastructure:</strong> Content strategy informed by AI research. We target the searches your ideal clients are actually making, not vanity keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Performance tracking:</strong> You know exactly where visitors come from, what they do, and why they leave. No guessing.</li>
<li><strong>Content engine:</strong> AI-assisted content creation for blogs, case studies, and landing pages that drive organic traffic consistently.</li>
</ul>
